Welcome to Weekly Reflection #9, this week, we mostly learned about function design. For example, we learned about contracts, examples, and definitions. Based off of what we learned, contracts are notes to ourselves about a function. As an example, a contract for a green triangle would be ```;gt: Number -> Image```. While an example is ```(gt 20)(triangle 20 "solid" "green")```, which means that a green triangle would be produced. Lastly a definition is simply just a name that we give a function in order to make it more easy to be accessed. An example of the definition for a green triangle is ```(define(gt size)(triangle size "solid" "green")```. All, contracts, examples, and definitions, are related to each other because a contract is needed to help form a function/example in computer science. To add on, a function/example is needed in order to form a definition for that function.
