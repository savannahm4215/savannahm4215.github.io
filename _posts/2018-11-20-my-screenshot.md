![SCREENSHOT](/images/SCREENSHOT.png)

Welcome, that picture above this text is my screenshot of the video game I'm working on in my Computer Science class. You may notice that I'm posting a blog on Tusday instead of Friday. As a result of Thanksgiving break, my classmates and I were required to do our posts today. Anyways, enough about my personal life, this week's blog post is going to be about the screenshot for my video game. In order to complete the task of making the screenshot, I had to use a website called WeScheme, after that I had to create a "Bootstrap Starter File" and from there I had to choose "Defining Values". Overall, the whole project was mainly naming your game and defining a BACKGROUND, PLAYER, DANGER, and TARGET picture. As seen in the picture above, I used various different pictures in my video game, also I named my game "Z0MBI3 RUN". So far, everything is turning out fine, which is surprising to me because at first I thought this project was going to be hard.
