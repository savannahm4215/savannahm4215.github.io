<p>On Monday, October 1st, my teacher had decided for my class and I to do a bit of a review on HTML. For example, we learned more about creating artifacts with computers and we were required to make connections between different representations of computing concepts. Additionally, on the same day, we learned the importance of a schedule. On Tuesday, October 2nd, my classmates and I were given a worksheet about the structure of hyper text markup. For example, we were required to find out the meaning of 3 HTML tags we weren't familar with, on the computer. On Wednesday, October 3rd, I don't have "Introduction to CS", sadly. However, on Thursday, October 4th, my classmates and I learned the meaning of a contract in Computer Science. We have also learned that in a computer science contract, if you give the computer what it expects, then it gives you what you expect. Lastly, on Friday, October 5th, my classmates and I were required to look up a flag on the computers and create them using various color papers.</p>

<p>Currently, out of all the things we did this week, I'd say that the most challenging part was when we had to find and create a flag of our choice. I believe this is the most challenging part only because it is difficult to make the flag as accurate as possible. Although I find creating the flag challenging, I feel like I am doing a good job so far.</p>
