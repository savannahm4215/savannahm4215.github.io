<h1>Part 1 - My Flag</h1>

<p> Welcome to Weekly Reflection #12, this week, my classmates and I were working on another Flag Project. This time our teacher assigned two flags that we would be creating and I was assigned the Cuba and Pakisan Flags. We were required to gather accurate geometric information about our flags to make it as close to the real deal as possible. We had the calulate ratio, which I believe was 2/3. As a whole, I had fun with this project. </p>
