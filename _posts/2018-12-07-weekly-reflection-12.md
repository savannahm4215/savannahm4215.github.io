<h1>Part 1 - My Flag</h1>

<p> Welcome to Weekly Reflection #12, this week, my classmates and I were working on another Flag Project. This time our teacher assigned two flags that we would be creating and I was assigned the Cuba and Pakisan Flags. We were required to gather accurate geometric information about our flags to make it as close to the real deal as possible. We had the calulate ratio, which I believe was 2/3. As a whole, I had fun with this project. </p>

<h1>Part 2 - My Questions and Challenges</h1>

<p> With project, I'd say that I have run into some challenges. One challenge I ran into while doing this project is that I didn't enough time to complete the project simce I didn't come to school the day before to work on the project. Additionally, one challenge I ran into while doing this project is the lack of construction paper left for me to make my collage. The challenges I have presented could easily be fixed if I have more time to do this project and if I was given fresh construction paper to work with.</p>
