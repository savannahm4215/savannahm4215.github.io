Welcome to Weekly Reflection #6, today, October 26th, marks the end of first 1/3 of my semester. As a result, my classmates and I are required to sum up what we have learned entirely so far. Basically, in the very beginning, we learned about the web and how it is able to function. For example, we learned about HTML, Markup Language, CSS, and files. Learning about those things helped us put together and create our websites.
