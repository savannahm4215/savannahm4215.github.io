  Welcome to Weekly Reflection #6, today, October 26th, marks the end of the first third of the Fall semester. As a result, my classmates and I are required to sum up what we have learned entirely so far. Basically, in the very beginning, we learned about the web and how it is able to function. For example, we learned about HTML, Markup Language, CSS, and files. Learning about those things helped us put together and create our websites. Today, learning about HTML, Markup Language, CSS, and files, really helped prepare me for creating my weekly reflections. After we learned about the web and how it is able to function, we moved on to the introduction of Github Pages so we could get started on our website. While learning about Github Pages, we learned how to create a new file. Most importantly we learned about repositories, which are the containers for a project, and we also learned about folders/directories, which are used as a container for files. Lastly, two more things I learned about Github Pages include the naming pattern expected by the computer and the naming pattern expected by the computer for home page. After learning about Github Pages, my teacher introduced the Video Game Project we are going to be working on. Since the Video Game Project was introduced, we went over video game coordinates and how the x and y axis plays a huge role in creating a video game. One connection I could make between my studies in mathematics and computer science is that the x and y axis are needed in order to actaully form a video game, coordinates are highly used in math but is seen in computer science. After the introduction to the Video Game Project, we began to learn about circles of evaluation, which led us to also learn about racket. As a result of learning racket, we were able to evaluate expressions using programming language. After learning about circles of evaluation, we began to learn about computer science contracts. While using these contracts I was able to create different shapes with a variety of colors and solve different expressions because when you give the computer what it expects, you get what you expect. After learning about computer science contracts, we began a Flag Project and in order to get this project done we needed to apply what we learned about contracts. Finally after completing Flag Project, we learned how to define a contract by giving it a name so it would be easier to access and from there we did pair programming, where we had to use contracts to make differnet shapes with your partner.
