Hello everyone, this weekly reflection is going to different than how they usually are because in this reflection I am going to be focused on one topic, which is my flag project. This week my school has taken us on a annual trip for two days, Thursday and Friday, and I didn't have Computer Science on Wednesday so this weekly reflection is about Tuesday.
