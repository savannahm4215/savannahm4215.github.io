Hello everyone, this weekly reflection is going to different than how they usually are because in this reflection I am going to be focused on one topic, which is my flag project. This week my school has taken us on an annual trip for two days, Thursday and Friday, and I didn't have Computer Science on Wednesday so this weekly reflection is about Tuesday. On Tuesday, October 16th, my classmates and I were assigned a Flag Project, in which we had to program a chosen flag. Overall, I found the project really fun because of the variety of programs we were able to use in order to make the shapes. However, one challenge I encountered while doing this project was trying to get the geometry of the flag correct because if it wasn't correct then the flag would look completely off.

        }
        body {
            background-color: rgb(172, 0, 245);
        }
        </style>
