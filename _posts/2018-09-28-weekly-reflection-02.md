<p>Hello once again, Welcome to my 2nd weekly reflection about my Computer Science classes. So far, I feel like I have a good understanding of the class. For example, I have successfully completed creating my website, which was the first project assigned. As a result, my classmates and I were assigned a new project, which is to make a video game with your table partner. During the course of the week, I've learned that...</p>

<li>Circles of Evaluation is used while making a video game</li>
<li>Coordinates play a very huge role in creating a video game</li>
<li>Each circle gets <strong>one</strong> function above the line</li>
<li>Functions= +,-,*, and division</li>
<li>Numbers in a expression represents values(nouns)</li>
<li>X-axis represents a ruler</li>
<li>When something moves from right to left in a video game, it means the x value is decreasing</li>
