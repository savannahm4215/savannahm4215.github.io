<p>Hello once again, Welcome to my 2nd weekly reflection about my Computer Science classes. So far, I feel like I have a good understanding of the class. For example, I have successfully completed creating my website, which was the first project assigned. As a result, my classmates and I were assigned a new project, which is to make a video game with your table partner. During the course of the week, I've learned that...</p>

<li>Circles of Evaluation is used while making a video game</li>
<li>Coordinates play a very huge role in creating a video game</li>
<li>Each circle gets <strong>one</strong> function above the line</li>
<li>Functions= +,-,*, and division</li>
<li>Numbers in a expression represents values(nouns)</li>
<li>X-axis represents a ruler</li>
<li>When something moves from right to left in a video game, it means the x value is decreasing</li>
  

<p>Currently, some challenges and/or struggles I have faced was getting used to using WeScheme, which is an online programming environment based on DrRacket and Scheme. I'm getting the hang of using the website to solve expressions, which is what we are working on so far in my Computer Science class. I've been attached to using a calculator to solve expressions, and I have never used a website like Wescheme before. However, I am eager to successfully be able to use Wescheme on my own.</p>
