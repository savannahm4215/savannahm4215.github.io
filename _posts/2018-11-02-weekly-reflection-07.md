Welcome to Weekly Reflection #7, today, November 2nd, marks the end of the school week. This week, Monday-Friday(except for Wednesday), we mostly focused on defining contracts. We mainly focused on defining contracts this week to make it easier for us to use code while making our video game project. This week was different from the other weeks because this week we were given worksheets to work on, the worksheets were based off of "Matching Expressions and Contracts". Some examples of contracts we learned was ```;gt: Number -> Image```, ```;scale: Number Image```, and ```;big-star: String -> Image```. After learning about these contracts, we learned how to define them, which makes it easier for us to access them. One big key idea we learned this week is that you need a contract to help code your expression.
