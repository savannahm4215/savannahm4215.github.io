Welcome to Weekly Reflection #8, this week was mostly chopped up, considering the fact that I didn't go to school on Tuesday and that my classmates and I don't have Computer Science on Wednesday. So, I only had 3 classes of Computer Science this week. However, during those three classes, my teacher has decided to bring the lesson back to Mastery Skill #1, which is applying contracts. On Monday, we learned about the contract POSN, which is a function that has both a x and y value. Some examples of the contracts we learned was ```;make-posn: Number Number -> Posn```, ```;posn-x: Posn -> Number```, and ```;posn-y: Posn -> Number. Additionally, today, November 9th, we were given two worksheets and were required to create a contract, two examples, and a definition for problem. The worksheets are used to help us better understand functions and makes it easier for us to access functions.
