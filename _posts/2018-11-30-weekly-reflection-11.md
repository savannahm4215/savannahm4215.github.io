Welcome to Weekly Reflection #11, this week, my classmates and I were given the whole class period to complete our midterm. On the next day, Tuesday, we were required to analyze the various maidterm questions and determine what mastery skill and level the question was on. Based off of the analysis we did, the question that caught my attention was question number 15. This question was based off of mastery skill 3 and was on Practitioner level. However, although question 15 was considered to be at Practitioner level, I didn't seem to be stumped by the question. The question basically asked you to choose a contract that best models the scenario that was presented to us. Based on the analysis of the midterms that was given to us, the correct answer was (a) and a total of 72.6% students got the question correct, including me. In my opinion, it was relatively easy to determine the right answer because if you read the question throughly, "We would like to design a function that takes in the url of a website and produces the linked image at half its original size", then it is clear that the output of the contract should be an image and the input of the function should be a string. Therefore, making the answer (a) ```;half-image: String -> Image```.
