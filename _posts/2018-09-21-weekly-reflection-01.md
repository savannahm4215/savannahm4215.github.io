So far, my impression of the class is pretty fun, considering I like working with computers. Overall, our first project, making a website, is going very well and is coming out really great. Personally, I can't wait until I get the hang of creating and designing a website all on my own. In Mr. Allatta's class, I've learned that...

<li><strong>The Web-is a system of interlinked documents accessed via the internet</strong></li>
<li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup</li>
<li>HTML is used to describe the structure language of the page, shape, size, and content)
<li>The M in HTML stands for Markup Languages, which is coding languages for describing documents)<strong>NOT programming</strong></li>
<li>CSS is the style of a webpage(font, color, and family)</li>
<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
