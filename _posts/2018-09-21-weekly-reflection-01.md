So far, my impression of the class is pretty fun, considering I like working with computers. Overall, our first project, making a website, is going very well and is coming out really great. Personally, I can't wait until I get the hang of creating and designing a website all on my own. In Mr. Allatta's class, I've learned that...

<li><strong>The Web-is a system of interlinked documents accessed via the internet</strong></li>
<li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup</li>
<li>HTML is used to describe the structure language of the page, shape, size, and content)
<li>The M in HTML stands for Markup Languages, which is coding languages for describing documents)<strong>NOT programming</strong></li>
<li>CSS is the style of a webpage(font, color, and family)</li>
<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>


<h1>Based on my experience in Computer Science class, I say that the most difficult part about it so far is doing things the way the computer is made to understand. By that I mean</h1>
