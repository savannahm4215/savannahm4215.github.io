<h1>Part 1: Our Learning</h1>

<p>Our learning, meaning me and my classmate's learning, is a step-by-step process. For example, one day we would learn how to code an image then the next day we would be required to go on the computers and code a given image. On Thursday October 11th, my classmates and I were required to do pair programming, which was really fun. During pair programming, my classmates and I were paired up in multiple groups of two, the main goal of the pair programming was to accurately code the series of shapes we were given. My guess is that pair programming will help us get one step closer to creating our video game.</p>
