<h1>Part 1: Our Learning</h1>

<p>Our learning, meaning me and my classmate's learning, is a step-by-step process. For example, one day we would learn how to code an image then the next day we would be required to go on the computers and code a given image. On Thursday October 11th, my classmates and I were required to do pair programming, which was really fun. During pair programming, my classmates and I were paired up in multiple groups of two, the main goal of the pair programming was to accurately code the series of shapes we were given. My guess is that pair programming will help us get one step closer to creating our video game in the near future.</p>

<h1>Part 2: My Learning</h1>

<p>Overall my learning is fast paced because in my Computer Science we use a certain style of notes. For example, we use cornell notes, which helps me keep my notes organized and help me study more efficiently when I have to. Based on the notes I took for the week, one connection I could make is that we needed to learn how to create a computer contract before moving on to coding shapes. For example, we have learned how to create a computer contract on October 9th of last week, which was needed to code shapes this week. I'd say that so far the most challenging part of this week was trying to code some of the shapes with my partner during pair programming because some shapes required you to code three shapes in one, which I found difficult. </p>
